# BusSync-Bus-Bunching
This React Native application simulates and monitors the real-time movement of 5 buses along a 25 km route using time-stamped location data. It uses Greedy algorithms and Dynamic Programming to generate speed adjustment suggestions for each bus. The goal is to ensure consistent intervals between consecutive buses for efficient transport flow.
